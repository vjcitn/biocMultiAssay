Translation Modeling for Cancer



General purpose is to model translational control of gene expression in the 
NCI60 panel that profile gene expression at mRNA and protein levels. 
Translational control is expected to uncouple mRNA from protein levels.

Rda files in branch 'tcm.NCI60' in biocMultiAssay:
---------------
'data.rda' contains initial data: 'biomart' has Ensembl BioMart v75 genomic 
coordinates , 'rna' and 'prot' has NCI60 RNA and protein  processed data. 
'annotation.rda' contains the assignment of genomic coordinates to genes 
profiled in NCI60 either by RNA or protein level.
'summarizedExperiment.rda' contains NCI60 expression data at either level.

Scripts in branch 'tcm.NCI60' in biocMultiAssay:

Explore data:
- 'annotation.R' returns 'annotation.rda'
- 'init.data.R' returns 'gRanges.rna.rda'
- 'summarizedExperiment.R' returns 'gRanges.prot.rda'
- 'nci60prot.R' returns proteins with log(Intensity,10)>=4 in >=5 cell lines



Model construction:
- fit.repeated.5fold.cv.knn.R returns summary of extra-samples 
  prediction error estimates by repeated cross-validation (RCV).
  Missing data are imputed by the package impute 

- extra.sample.predict.analyze.R returns histograms of prediction
  error estimates by using: 1) root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE),
  2) correlation between predicted and observed values in testing subsets

- fit_functions.R contains several functions including for RCV

- fit_functions_trim.R differs by fit_functions.R for the addition of
  predictors trimming to RCV according to the resolution of linear
  dependencies among predictors (caret package)
