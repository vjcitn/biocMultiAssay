## Classification of TCGA samples by subtype and GCIMP status. Scores represent the subtype posterior probabilities using the Affymetrix platform. ,,,,,,,## For samples with a posterior probability < 0.5, the Agilent platform gave consistent results and a posterior probability > 0.85. Samples with conflicting classification from the two platforms were ignored.,,,,,,,## log2 ratio columns give copy number, last column indicates whether exons 2-7 have significantly lower copy number than 7+.  See ,,,,,,,## Status of EGFRvIII mutation was determined as previously described (Szerlip et al., 2012). We compared the mean aCGH copy number ratios of probes in the deleted region of EGFR (Agilent probe ids A_14_P102368, A_16_P17952602, A_16_P38034515, A_16_P01718265), with the mean ratios of the probes in the 3â€™ prime end of EGFR, downstream of exon 7 (A_14_P133869, A_16_P17952748, A_16_P01718353, A_16_P17952840, A_16_P38034765, A_14_P106592). Difference of > 1 standard deviation was considered significant.ID,Subtype,Score,GCIMP,GCIMP Score,EGFR Exon 2-7 log2 ratio,EGFR Exon 7+ log2
